this folder is (perhaps)
to be used as a place to store helpful utility files/folders

what?

well, here's the example that prompted me to make the folder:

I'm looking into unit testing with QUnit.  QUnit tests involve an HTML page with links to a particular stylesheet and script from the QUnit CDN.  I want to make a script that adds the barebones necessary file structure for javascript unit testing.  I can make a file in this utils folder, and an accompanying script that injects a copy of that file into the working directory.
